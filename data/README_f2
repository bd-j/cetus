> f2_apcanfinal_6phot_v2.fits = This is the latest version of the AP catalog, including integrated photometry.  The "f2" label denotes this fact - second iteration of the full AP dataset (both rounds of data collection), as opposed to the last major set of AP IDs that were tied to "d4" - the fourth iteration of the original AP Round 1 classifications.

> Note on Object Selection: This catalog contains -ALL- AP objects that were identified by at least 20% of classifiers.  To select a sample of clusters, first calculate ClusterFrac = ViewFrac * (1-GalFrac).  Clusters are currently defined as: ClusterFrac >= 0.35 AND GalFrac < 0.2.  For a cleaner sample, bump the ClusterFrac threshold up to 0.7 -- at this level there will be almost zero contamination from single stars or other marginal cluster candidates.

> One note on the photometry: If DETSIG=0 and the corresponding MAG and SIG outputs are missing, that means there was no data available (ie - no image coverage in that wavelength).  If DETSIG=0 and there are entries in the MAG and SIG columns, this means that I did not detect any flux above the level of the sky, then the MAG column provides the sky level and SIG=0.75.

> +ID Matching
> f2_apmatch_known.fits = Matches AP IDs to Nelson's (and others) previously known cluster catalogs.  The file also includes boolean columns that provide the classification from the previous catalog -- not all are accurate according to our AP results.
> f2_apmatch_yr1all.fits = Matches AP IDs to Yr1 PC IDs (Johnson et al. 2012).

> +Star Count Metadata
> clusterdata_apf2_v1.fits = Using the current CMD extractions from the 6-band catalogs, I derived some additional metadata for a subsample of the AP objects.  Not all 8k+ objects have entries here; subsample of likely clusters and objects with CMDs currently in hand -- this excludes tooth objects for the moment (v2 will happen sometime soon).

> The NMS_X columns are likely the most useful to you: number of MS stars (F475W-F814W < 1) brighter than F814W=X magnitude. Some of the other columns:
> NSTAR = just as you think -- total number of detected sources in the photometry file.
> BRIGHTSTAR = 5 brightest sources, defined by their F814W mags.
> F475FULL = F475W integrated magnitude
> F475MINUSX = integrated mag minus the X brightest stars (those listed in BRIGHTSTAR)
> F475FRACX = fraction of the total integrated light made up by the X brightest stars.
