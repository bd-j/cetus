Here you go. The files have been  named for the objects - the original files often had
different names, so the "Object" keyword in the files will often be different - ignore that.
Many of the objects were observed more than once, I give you the separate files - what you
have been working with were the combined files (not to mention the flux calibration and
deredshifting).  Each observation has three separate files, at various states of reduction. For instance:

011.B380-G313.v.fits contains the sky subtracted, linearized spectrum, with variance and sky as separate rows
011.B380-G313.s.fits is that with flux calibration applied
011.B380-G313.z.fits is that with the wavelength calibration adjusted for redshift (no rebinning
has been applied, which was the case for the spectra you have been working with).

You'll note as I just did that these don't look as good as the web pictures. The latter were smoothed
for presentation.

I am having some of these spectra re-reduced with our new SDSS-like pipeline, which will also
give versions in which rebinning has not occurred.  I'll send those along when ready.

I'm happy to send you many, many more spectra, when you are ready!
